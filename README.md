## Multiple Regression Analysis Using Airbnb Data

The objective of this project is to make onboarding process for Boston homeowners easier by suggesting to them how much they should charge for their property.

The dataset is from Airbnb, which includes about 37 features and 3,586 observations. To give an overview of this data, some features are the following:
- neighbourhood
- property type
- room type
- bed type
- amenities
- reviews rating

This project is done using R and I will follow Google's R style guide.

### Analysis 1

*Data Wrangling*: Please see the cleaned [data](https://github.com/gpadolina/multipleRegressionAnaysisWithAirbnb/blob/master/priceModel.R)
that I produced by leveraging dplyr and tidyr libraries using R.
